### New Cloudflared Secures Data Over Public Internet
- [Using Cloudflare Tunnels For Hosting & Certificates Without Exposing Ports On Your Firewall - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eojWaJQvqiw&t=346s) 
	- The visibility for plaintext traffic will occur within the system where cloudflared is setup, but not over the public internet
	- In the case of docker, anything on the raspberry pi will be able to see traffic, but not the public internet. This can be fixed with self-signed certs.

## Setup Tunnel on Server (Docker > Ubuntu > Rpi3)
1. Go to "Zero Trust"
	1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202165754906.png)
2. Go to Tunnels
	1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202165820900.png)
3. Add a tunnel
	1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202170759492.png)
4. Name the tunnel
	1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202171458366.png)
5. Copy the command to install and run the `cloudflared` connector for our raspberry pi docker network of services
	1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202171711786.png)
6. SSH back into the server (raspberry pi 3 in this case) and run the command
	1. Latest image will be grabbed, installed, then ran
		1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202171844727.png)
7. Check connector
	1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202172811306.png)
9. Copy pgadmin Url
	1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202173252316.png)
10. Configure all the parameters for the tunnel
	1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202174654722.png)
11. Test connection to server with new URL

## Add Additional Security to Tunnel Access

### Use One Time PIN for Supported Email in List
If we want better security, then we need to configure access control for the services despite the fact that the services have logins.  

To have access control, we need to have conditions that must be met with identities.  This essentially means using other third parties as identity providers.  A simple example of this would be letting certain emails have access to the tunnel, then send OTPs (one time passwords) to their emails to verify.

1. Access > Applications > Group > Add a Group
	1. cybersader-users
	2. Define group criteria
		1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202212820954.png)
2. Access > Applications > Add an application
	1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202212103108.png)
	2. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202213114693.png)
3. Go back and edit Access > Tunnels

### Using GitHub as an Identity Provider (IdP)
We can actually use GitHub as an IdP here and the great part is that I have MFA already configured with them, so doing so turns my login process into one that is super secure for my self-hosted applications.  

Here's the identity pattern with that then knowledge of URL > GitHub account (email knowledge)> (GitHub password knowledge, Duo MFA)

1. Set up GitHub Authentication
	1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202223328627.png)
	2. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202223347519.png)
	3. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202223407214.png)
	4. Follow the GitHub setup instructions
		1. GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > OAuth Apps
			1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202223703049.png)
		2. Get the team domain from Settings > Custom Pages
			1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202224135437.png)
		3. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202224251217.png)
		4. Make sure to hit the test button too and enable Cloudflare
		5. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202224741801.png)
2. Configure Application (in Cloudflare) to use Github for Authentication
	1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202225653149.png)
	2. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202225701129.png)
3. Test Login
	1. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202225833512.png)
	2. ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231202225855909.png)

- We could do logging and look at activities, the 5 tuple, and who's accessing what or we could deploy logging from within the docker system and tunnel that out as well with special access
