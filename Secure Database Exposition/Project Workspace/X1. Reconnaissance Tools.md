## Google Dorking
> Commands (or "dorks") for the world's most popular search engine
- **cache** - this command will show you the cached version of any website. `cache: securitytrails.com`
- **allintext** - searches for specific text contained on any web page. `allintext: hacking tools`
- **allintitle** - exactly the same as allintext, but will show pages that contain titles with X characters. `allintitle:"Security Companies"`
- **allinurl** - it can be used to fetch results whose URL contains all the specified characters. `allinurl client area`
- **filetype** - used to search for any kind of file extensions, for example, if you want to search for jpg files you can use: `filetype: jpg`
- **inurl** - this is exactly the same as allinurl, but it is only useful for one single keyword. `inurl: admin`
- **intitle** - used to search for various keywords inside the title, for example, `intitle:security tools` will search for titles beginning with “security” but “tools” can be somewhere else in the page.
- **inanchor** - this is useful when you need to search for an exact anchor text used on any links. `inanchor:"cyber security"`
- **intext** - useful to locate pages that contain certain characters or strings inside their text. `intext:"safe internet"`
- **link** - will show the list of web pages that have links to the specified URL. `link: microsoft.com`
- **site** - will show you the full list of all indexed URLs for the specified domain and subdomain. `site:securitytrails.com`
- ***** - wildcard used to search pages that contain “anything” before your word. For example, `how to * a website`, will return “how to…” design/create/hack, etc… “a website”.
- **|** - this is a logical operator, for example, `"security" "tips"` will show all the sites which contain “security” or “tips,” or both words.
- **+** - used to concatenate words, useful to detect pages that use more than one specific key. `security + trails`
- **–** - minus operator is used to avoiding showing results that contain certain words, for example, `security -trails` will show pages that use “security” in their text, but not those that have the word “trails.”
