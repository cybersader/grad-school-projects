	- You can install xubuntu or lubuntu, but it will be glitchy with lower RAM (I have no clue how much I have)

- How much RAM do I have
	- Run `free -h`
	- Welp I have 1 GB for memory...oof.
	- Seems I won't be able to run a Desktop in my Pi or it will definitely be struggling

#### Compatible Desktops for RPI
- [6 Desktop Environments You Can Install on Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.makeuseof.com/desktop-environments-you-can-run-on-a-raspberry-pi/)
	- GNOME
	- KDE plasma
	- Xfce
	- Sugar
	- MATE
	- Cinnamon
#### Below Steps don't work on 1GB RPI
- I'm sure a Raspberry Pi 4 works great with all this desktop setup, and what not, but not the 3

I wanted to run a desktop on the little computer, but it turns out that desktops, other than the ones specifically meant for Rpis, can barely run even a lightweight desktop on 1GB of RAM.

```
- Plug in HDMI, then plug in power cord
- Run commands to get desktop for the Pi
	- sudo apt update 
	- sudo apt upgrade
	- Choose a desktop:
		- sudo apt install xubuntu-desktop
		- sudo apt install lubuntu-desktop
	- sudo reboot
	- Log into desktop
- Notes: getting the desktop installed takes awhile
```

# Opening Up Ubuntu
- I opened it, but it was really slow with the UI and froze at one point
	- ![](../../__attachments/Secure%20Database%20Exposition/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231129221152804.png)
- Found the issue...ACTUALLY..nevermind I didn't
	- I had a lightning bolt in the top right which means "low voltage" which can cause LOTS of issues
	- [raspbian - What does the lightning bolt mean? - Raspberry Pi Stack Exchange](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/57963/what-does-the-lightning-bolt-mean) 
	- Solution:  it was plugged into the back of my pc, but also the cord could be the issue.

	- [Dealing with the Low Voltage Warning on the Raspberry Pi - Pi My Life Up](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-low-voltage-warning/) 
	- I'm using Ubuntu 23, which is probably worse, and I was using the 32 bit version at first which might actually be incompatible with the 64 bit ARM processor on the RPI....I'm such noobðŸ˜†
	- I can buy power supplies here - [Buy a Raspberry Pi 1, 2 and 3 Power Supply â€“ Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-universal-power-supply/)
- Would need to buy power supply rated for 5V and at least 2.5 amps
	- I have a 5V 3amps, but still getting thunderbolt.  Not enough time to sit and figure that out.

## Giving up on desktop
- Ubuntu desktop is not a viable option for the RPi 3, so I have to turn to remote access for my Ubuntu Server

# Ubuntu Remote Access
## Setup SSH on Ubuntu
- [How to Enable SSH on Ubuntu - Pi My Life Up](https://pimylifeup.com/ubuntu-enable-ssh/)

Install SSH server for Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

Verify SSH server is running (run if not running - 2nd command):
```
sudo systemctl status ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

Get IP to Connect:
```
hostname -I
```

Enable Password Authentication:
- [configuration - How can I allow SSH password authentication from only certain IP addresses? - Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/101670/how-can-i-allow-ssh-password-authentication-from-only-certain-ip-addresses)
- [How to Enable SSH Password Authentication - ServerPilot](https://serverpilot.io/docs/how-to-enable-ssh-password-authentication/) 

```
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Reset the SSH service:
```
service ssh reload
```

## SSH Into Ubuntu Server
On client terminal, run:
```
ssh username@IP
```

Type in the password and....:
