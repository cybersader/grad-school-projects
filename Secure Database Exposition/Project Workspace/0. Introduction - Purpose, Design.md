# The Database Security Component of the Project?
## How I View DB Security?
When trying to conceptualize the idea of databases and then their security, I become a bit stumped.  Sometimes there have been terms like "database security" in which I attempt to have a more "principled", foundational, or even philosophical and fundamental view of what that means in security.  However, sometimes I overestimate other people's notions or what they think that term means.  Database security means protecting databases and having "peace of mind" with them.  My problem is with where we draw the line of what makes databases significant.  My understanding of databases leads me to believe that they are application-level systems that map hardware storage whether vertical or horizontal, singular or distributed, and then there are other services or functionality that can be integrated with such applications.  Databases are supposed to be organized interfaces sometimes with special implementations for the actual storage piece.  Lots of the ideas of security with databases can be applied to AppSec, network security, IAM (identity and access management), and vulnerability management.  We have to then ask what is uniquely applicable to databases, and I would have to say - not much.
## How I will apply DB Security
I like Postgres, so I wanted to use Postgres. Next I thought of ways to use Postgres in business use cases and security problems that have to be solved with that. Some of these scenarios were more doable than others when considering the constraints I have: low budget, low networking experience, limited time, and having to actually learn something useful and enticing.  Therefore, I chose to self-host and look at dilemmas with remote access to a database.

A common scenario at home or with small-scale self-hosted projects is to set up a system of applications, processes, or protocols to implement simple remote access.  Remote access could refer to automated services or servers speaking with the on-prem/at-home server or it could refer to using some interface to look at the database and manipulate it with SQL. 

Ultimately, I decided to pursue solutions for remote access, but more specifically the idea of "secure exposition." To threat model, I'll use a tool or two for reconnaissance.  The goal is to show various methods for "exposition" and how their threat models or use cases differ.

# "Secure Database Exposition"
## "Exposed" - what it mean?
Often, implementing remote access on a database requires that it be exposed to the the public internet.  In the general sense, if something is exposed, then that means any sort of information or utility can be obtained in relation to that system. 

The degree to which something is exposed can vary.  Sometimes the device won't respond in any way to any requests of any kind.  Sometimes it will only say what sorts of services are running on ports.  Maybe the device isn't reachable to any degree.  Maybe it's a URL that resolves to a server running on someone's home network with a login page open to the public internet to send requests to.

# Self-Hosting!
One of the big reasons for this project is to become familiar with self-hosting. It's something I've had the time to do, but I've known about its value for awhile now and follow lots of people online who do it often.  I've always loved the idea of open source software and the benefits it brings, but also the challenges.  Open source, by nature, is not easy to do and to grow.  Lots of maintainers of OSS (open source software) just get busy or their managed cloud option isn't used enough, so they have to quit the SaaS business.

Self-hosting teaches one how to host, but that also means managing all of the layers that they usually wouldn't: hardware and storage, networking, virtualization, platforms, configurations, security, patching...the list goes on. 

There are lots of benefits though too: low cost (depends), active community (depends), free usually, privacy usually, and better alignment to your use case.

## Components
Hardware:
- Rpi 3
- keyboard with usb
- home network with modem and ISP connection, routers, etc.

Rpi Server Software:
- Ubuntu

- Portainer
- Postgres

Networking Software and Tech:
- CloudFlare Tunnels

Recon:
- PC 
- Zenmap/Nmap
- Shodan? (maybe)

Database Testing:
- DBeaver?
- Online Postgres GUI

## Threat Modeling & Recon - Postgres Risks
- Recon is how hackers exploit RCE (remote code execution) vulnerabilities and try to be profitable. Without recon, it's hard if not impossible to be a cost effective hacker.
- I want to show how port forwarding is dangerous if you don't know what you're doing and how relying on a service like Cloudflare Tunnels is the way to go because you avoid lots of issues that could come up:
	- Updating firewall when you switch the server or client up
	- Needing to configure your home router and worry about stuff with that
- Ultimately, Cloudflare Tunnels is more secure and definitely more convenient
- It's also easy to set up your DNS because they have services baked into Cloudflare for that
- Cloudflare is also free for the most part
	- I haven't looked into why or how they're free, but I remember something about large-scale network analytics.  I don't believe they have an unethical model.
- Database services have a lot of functionality and communication that happens.  Essentially, one has to be careful, especially, at home when they start to open up database services to the internet which have direct access to storage hardware and high value data that can be ransomed
