	- One of the key projects I'm involved in today is [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com) (HIBP), a free service that aggregates data breaches and helps people establish if they've been impacted by malicious activity on the web. As well as being a useful service for the community, HIBP has given me an avenue to ship code that runs at scale on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, one of the best ways we have of standing up services on the web today.

## Wordlist Generation for Password Spraying
- https://www.horizon3.ai/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-password-spray/
	- NodeZero generates probable passwords to spray based on commonly known breached passwords, context-specific terms such as the company name or domain name, or a custom dictionary supplied by the user.
	- Attackers know that most companies have set up a password policy to enforce a minimum password length of 8 characters, password complexity rules (including lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters), and periodic rotation of passwords. Password complexity and rotation policies have ironically led users to creating more predictable passwords such as passwords starting with an uppercase letter, ending in 1!,, or containing seasons and years. NodeZero optimizes for these cases to maximize the likelihood of success.
	- In addition to spraying probable weak passwords, NodeZero also attempts to spray any passwords it finds organically during the course of a pentest, just like a real-world attacker would do. These are passwords that may be found through unintended data exposure or exploitation, and they may not necessarily be weak. This form of password spray is used to exploit password reuse across multiple accounts.

	- Credential-guessing attacks often exploit passwords that were reused across a user's online accounts. To learn how organizations can better protect users, we retrospectively analyzed our university's vulnerability to credential-guessing attacks across twenty years. Given a list of university usernames, we searched for matches in both data breaches from hundreds of websites and a dozen large compilations of breaches. After cracking hashed passwords and tweaking guesses, we successfully guessed passwords for 32.0% of accounts matched to a university email address in a data breach, as well as 6.5% of accounts where the username (but not necessarily the domain) matched. Many of these accounts remained vulnerable for years after the breached data was leaked, and passwords found verbatim in breaches were nearly four times as likely to have been exploited (i.e., suspicious account activity was observed) than tweaked guesses. Over 70 different data breaches and various username-matching strategies bootstrapped correct guesses. In surveys of 40 users whose passwords we guessed, many users were unaware of the risks to their university account or that their credentials had been breached. This analysis of password reuse at our university provides pragmatic advice for organizations to protect accounts.
