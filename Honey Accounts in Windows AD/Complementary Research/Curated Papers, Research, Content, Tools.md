	- Password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain. Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.

## Wordlist Generation for Password Spraying
- https://www.horizon3.ai/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-password-spray/
	- NodeZero generates probable passwords to spray based on commonly known breached passwords, context-specific terms such as the company name or domain name, or a custom dictionary supplied by the user.
	- Attackers know that most companies have set up a password policy to enforce a minimum password length of 8 characters, password complexity rules (including lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters), and periodic rotation of passwords. Password complexity and rotation policies have ironically led users to creating more predictable passwords such as passwords starting with an uppercase letter, ending in 1!,, or containing seasons and years. NodeZero optimizes for these cases to maximize the likelihood of success.
	- In addition to spraying probable weak passwords, NodeZero also attempts to spray any passwords it finds organically during the course of a pentest, just like a real-world attacker would do. These are passwords that may be found through unintended data exposure or exploitation, and they may not necessarily be weak. This form of password spray is used to exploit password reuse across multiple accounts.
