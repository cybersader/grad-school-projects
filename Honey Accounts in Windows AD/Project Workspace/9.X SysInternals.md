The Sysinternals utilities are a collection of tools used for various investigative purposes on Windows domains. For example, and as will be demonstrated in this lab, the student has an opportunity to interact with ADExplorer for schema attribute investigations. You will likely discover credentials during this lab.  
  
**These credential discoveries will be useful to you later.**  
  
You might start a local creds file, you might keep a keepass, lastpass, or 1password database for this class. When penetration testing, purple teaming your own organization, or executing related activities, keeping track of credential compromises is critical.  
- HR will need to know which accounts got popped  
- Your customers need to know which accounts got popped  
- Compromised accounts need password resets  
- **Keep track of these creds for other labs**
# Objectives:
* Become familiar with the ADExplorer SysInternals Application  
* Identify poor AD hygiene
# Methods
* Download SysInternals from Microsoft using PowerShell  
* Launch ADExplorer and investigate the domain

# Download SysInternals and Start ADExplorer
First, lets open PowerShell on our Workstation and use PowerShell to download SysInternals. Then we will start ADEXplorer.

```powershell
whoami # make sure you are a domain user
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
cd C:\users\doadmin\Downloads\
Invoke-WebRequest -URI "https://download.sysinternals.com/files/SysinternalsSuite.zip" -OutFile sysinternals.zip
expand-archive .\sysinternals.zip
cd sysinternals
.\ADExplorer.exe -accepteula
```

Messed up commands just a little bit at first:

# ADExplorer: Connect
After opening ADExplorer, connecting to the Domain is easy. Click ok to connect. That easy! This is because the workstation is already joined to the domain and the current login context is a domain user.

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206001440769.png)

Once connected, the domain loads up in the well formatted OU view.

# ADExplorer: Search
Next up, let's search for a few attributes of interest and see if we can find anything interesting.

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206001546599.png)

Available schema attributes are listed in the **Attribute** drop down. The search is **Relational**ly conditional and allows **Value** entries.

Take the following screenshot as an example. In this case, we searched for ms-Mcs-AdmPwd which is a schema attribute that stores cleartext LAPS passwords. If not properly secured, this attribute can be taken advantage of to gain local admin access to exposed systems.

Another interesting attribute stored in Active Directory is the **Description** field. Your first credential compromise will be discovered here.

# ADExplorer: Text / Copy / Paste / Access
ADExplorer has unfortunately severely limited access to copy and paste operations. While we could see that Ella had a password stored in her AD object's attributes, it is difficult to export that to text. Please follow the logic outlined below to export any similar object's attributes to text and search through them with PowerShell for the password. Follow this process for whichever user object you have identified.

 **The following section of the lab should be completed from the DC's PowerShell context.**

Finally, you can copy those attributes to text format.

# Investigate Further with PowerShell
After having copied the attributes from in the last step, lets gather information about the same account, this time using PowerShell.

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Identity Ella_Mejia -Properties *
Get-ADUser -filter * -properties Description | where -Property Description -like *password*
```

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206002215402.png)

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206002220048.png)

Next, lets see all the attributes that we can gather about the "Doadmin" account.

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Identity doadmin -Properties *
```

Information identified within this lab may be helpful in future labs.

Some of these accounts can now be pivoted for several purposes, including BloodHound, Kerberoasting, potential lateral movement, mailbox access, et cetera.

# Hunt: Deception Tech
Remember the earlier deception lab? We created users and objects that we want to use as decoys in the environment for detecting potentially malicious activities. We have an opportunity now to test a detection with the decoys.

This is a multi-step process and is complicated. This may be the most challenging lab in the course.

- Step 1: Run get-aduser queries to gather the decoy account GUIDs
- Step 2: Copy starting kql language in to Sentinel
- Step 3: Replace "Object" placeholder with current value
- Step 4: Save query for future use
- Step 5: Create alert for any future contact made against these accounts

Run the following commands on the workstation if you installed RSAT. If you did not install RSAT, run these commands on the domain controller.

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Identity DOLabsADex -Properties "ObjectGuid"
Get-ADUser -Identity DOLabsAnyRead -Properties "ObjectGuid"
Get-ADUser -Identity DOLabsDA -Properties "ObjectGuid"
```

DOLabsADex:
```
41a432e4-6683-4e99-a468-a3adc9ad20ef
```

DOLabsAnyRead:
```
f58192fc-11ea-4012-a675-dcfc3b729922
```

DOLabsDA:
```
a66c10e8-c045-438b-b657-f424bad0c157
```

The following events are used in the next query:

- [4662](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4662): An operation was peformed by an object

This query requires copying GUIDs from PowerShell over to KQL's query input. Perform a copy paste operation (in PowerShell: **Highlight text, strike Enter**) from PS to KQL ObjectName contains " Paste unique GUID strings here ". Repeat this process for the DoLabsADex, DOLabsAnyRead, and DOLabsDA accounts.

Query template:
```
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4662
| where ObjectName contains "<Decoy-1-GUID>" or ObjectName contains "<Decoy-2-GUID>" or ObjectName contains "<Decoy-3-GUID>"
| project TimeGenerated , Account , ObjectName , Activity
```

My query:
```
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4662
| where ObjectName contains "41a432e4-6683-4e99-a468-a3adc9ad20ef" or ObjectName contains "f58192fc-11ea-4012-a675-dcfc3b729922" or ObjectName contains "a66c10e8-c045-438b-b657-f424bad0c157"
| project TimeGenerated , Account , ObjectName , Activity
```
