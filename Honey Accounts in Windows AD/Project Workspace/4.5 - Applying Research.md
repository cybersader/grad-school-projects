## Password Spraying
- (Prior Work to Next Paper) [Gossamer: Securely Measuring Password-based Logins | USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/sanusi-bohuk) 
	- "a new login service instrumentation tool called Gossamer. It securely records information about login requests, including certain carefully chosen statistics about the passwords used in the requests"
- [Araña: Discovering and Characterizing Password Guessing Attacks in Practice | USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/islam) 
	- "Understanding and characterizing attacker strategies is critical to improving security, but doing so has been challenging thus far due to the sensitivity of login services and the lack of ground truth labels for benign and malicious login requests."
	- "Gossamer was deployed for seven months at one university (U1) and three months at another (U2)"
	- "Even with the measurements provided by Gossamer, discovering attacks represents a tricky bootstrapping problem. The compromise logs do not implicate specific login requests and, more broadly, there is no ground truth anywhere in the dataset for attacks. This makes the supervised machine learning approaches used in prior work inapplicable to our setting."
	- "We develop a new analysis pipeline that we call Araña. Crucially, it focuses not on individual requests but sets of login requests emanating from the same IP within a day. This ensures sufficient signal about client behavior for patterns to emerge. We then built an application-specific filtering, clustering, and manual analysis approach. We filter out likely-benign login request sets using custom heuristics, such as filtering out IP addresses exhibiting high login success rates."
	- "We then use an unsupervised learning approach, specifically agglomerative clustering, with a custom distance function tailored to login sets. This helps us identify clusters of login sets that can be manually analyzed with little effort to discover attack campaigns—sets of login requests likely to be submitted by the same attacker."
	- "We use it to discover and characterize a diverse set of 29 attack clusters. Many are high volume credential stuffing attacks that submit on average one password per targeted username and exhibit a notable fraction of username-password pairs appearing in breaches. In addition to the more simplistic stuffing attacks that quickly flood requests from a handful of IP addresses, Araña allowed for discovering widely distributed attacks that may originate from hundreds of different IP addresses. Some of these attacks try to be “low and slow”, submitting a low number of requests per day at a slow rate. This confirms that credential stuffing attackers attempt to evade countermeasures that focus on individual high volume IPs. These credential stuffing attacks are unfortunately effective: We uncover hundreds of potential successful logins by attackers for usernames not flagged already in compromise reports prepared by security engineers."
	- "We are also able to discover lower volume, targeted attacks by focusing on Araña-identified clusters that exhibit a large number of requests to individual usernames. For example, we identified an attack campaign made up of two clusters that targeted 127 users with on average 25 guessed passwords per user. These attacks included successful logins, suggesting this targeted strategy can also work for attackers."
	- "We discuss many other attack campaigns in the body. Overall, our analyses highlight a number of important takeaways for authentication system designers. First, they suggest that, perhaps unsurprisingly, credential stuffing attacks remain a primary vector for account compromise. This, plus the fact that most compromised users in our study also had passwords in known breaches, underscores the urgent need for broader use of breach alerting APIs (e.g.)."
	- **"Researchers have also developed natural language processing techniques to improve guess generation"**
	- **"Credential stuffing is one kind of online guessing attack— an attack that remotely attempts to log into a service with guessed credentials. Other examples of guessing attacks include password spraying attacks that submit a few very popular passwords against a large number of user accounts and credential tweaking attacks that submit slight variants of breached passwords"**

- [[2309.03384] Measuring Website Password Creation Policies At Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03384)
	- "To date, there has been limited investigation into what password creation policies are actually deployed by sites. Existing works are mostly dated and all studies relied on manual evaluations, assessing a small set of sites (at most 150, skewed towards top sites). Thus, we lack a broad understanding of the password policies used today. In this paper, we develop an automated technique for inferring a website’s password creation policy, and apply it at scale to measure the policies of over 20K sites, over two orders of magnitude (∼135x) more sites than prior work."
	- "Passwords remain the de facto standard method for online authentication"
	- "To date, there has been significantly less investigation into how website operators actually manage password authentication and what password creation policies they enforce. A handful of studies have manually analyzed the password policies of top websites. However, due to the manual methods used in this prior work, the scale of investigation is heavily limited, with the largest entailing only 150 websites. The considered website populations also skew towards highly-ranked sites, across a few countries (i.e., US, Germany, and China). Furthermore, most studies were conducted over a decade ago, predating significant updates to password guidelines, including those by NIST and Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). Thus, we lack a large-scale modern understanding of the password creation policies deployed by sites today, the authentication security and usability implications of these policies, and the adoption rate of authentication recommendations."
	- "In this work, we seek to close this gap. Given the incredible diversity of the web, doing so is challenging, as websites and their password authentication are implemented in a myriad of ways, and password policy information is often not explicitly published. In this work, we develop a web measurement method that automatically infers password creation policies in a blackbox fashion"

In this work, we develop a web measurement method that automatically infers password creation policies in a blackbox fashion"
	- **"We find that the most common policies today enforce few requirements on passwords, aligning with recent policy recommendations (e.g., NIST’s 2017 guidelines). However, counter to modern standards, acceptance of short passwords is widespread, with over half of sites allowing passwords of six characters or shorter, and an unexpected 12% lacking any minimum length requirements. Furthermore, 30% of sites do not support certain recommended characters in passwords, including spaces and special characters. We also observe only about 12% of sites using password blocklists, resulting in the majority of sites being vulnerable to password spraying attacks"**
	- "We also observe that top-ranked sites tend to support stronger policy parameters. Through case studies of weak policy parameters, we identify how web frameworks and default configurations may be driving factors."
	- Various password params used when analyzing password policies:
		- Lengths
			- overall length
		- Restrictive
			- digits, upper, lower, special, combinations
			- letter strat
		- Permissive - allowing certain characteristics without requiring them
			- dictionary words permitted within password where a word is at least 3 letters
			- sequential characters - logical sequences of 3+ characters permitted in the password
			- repeated characters - 3+ repeated characters
			- long digit pws
			- short digit pws
			- personal information/identifiers - personal info in the password
			- space - whitespaces
			- emojis
			- unicode letters
			- Popular Special Symbols - allows one of top 4 special symbols in the password
			- Breached Passwords - a common password from a known password leak is permitted
	- 2) Permitted Sequences (𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑝 , 𝑃𝑠𝑒𝑞 , 𝑃𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡, 𝑃𝑖𝑑 ): Here, we construct a password with the evaluated sequence and test for acceptance. For repeated characters (𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑝 ) the sequence is three repeating consecutive characters (e.g., 111, aaa, or AAA), and for sequential characters (𝑃𝑠𝑒𝑞) it is abc, 123, or ABC. For both parameters, we select one as permitted by other policy parameters. For dictionary words (𝑃𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡), we identify the longest word (up to 8 characters) permitted in a password as constrained by other policy parameters, and test the inclusion of the most common English word. For personal identifiers (𝑃𝑖𝑑 ), the evaluated sequence is a subset of the username used during account creation. We choose our usernames to be a 3-letter names followed by 5 random digits, and the sequence is the 3-letter portion of the username (e.g. if the registered username is joe31426, we evaluate the acceptance of the sequence "joe" in the password)
	- 4) Breached Passwords (𝑃𝑏𝑟): With other parameters determined, we test the highest-ranked breached password satisfying them (e.g. if 𝐷𝐼𝐺𝑚𝑖𝑛 ≥ 1, 𝑅𝑙𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 = 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒, 𝐿𝑚𝑖𝑛 ≥ 6, all other restrictive parameters are false and permissive parameters are true, Attempted Password: 123456, the most popular password in satisfying policy parameters). If accepted, 𝑃𝑏𝑟 = 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒, otherwise true.
	- Testing websites:
		- Out of the 1M domains, we find signup pages on 141K domains (14.12%). While we could successfully submit one signup attempt (including CAPTCHA solving) on 59K domains, we were able to fully evaluate (across multiple attempts) 26K domains. Finally, we filter out domains where all signup attempts are reported as successes or failures (as this is not feasible, especially with our sanity check signup attempt), or where all trailing attempts are failures (we test permissive parameters last, and as discussed shortly, it is highly unlikely that any site truly does not permit all tested characters/structures). This filtering leaves us with 20,119 domains for which we successfully analyze password policies. We manually validated our results are accurate on a random sample of 100 evaluated sites. We note that this population is two orders of magnitude larger than prior work (as discussed in Section 2), 
	- Our analyzed sites are also broadly distributed across rankings (unlike prior work’s focus on top sites)
	- Surprisingly, the most popular policy (8.3% of sites) allowed passwords of any length without any constraints. . In addition, 5 top policies also cap the password’s length (including one that limits passwords to only 20 characters). Other password constraints are less prominent in top policies, with only 4 of the top 15 policies applying any non-length constraints. Most policies appear on only one site, which highlights enormous diversity in the policies deployed (with implications for guidelines, password usability, and password managers, as will be discussed in Section 6).  As the top 15 policies (Section 4.2) capture only a third of our sites
	- Case Study: Required Word Structure and Letter Start. We manually investigated 100 domains requiring a two-word structure as well as domains enforcing letter start, confirming our inference. We did not identify common platforms or frameworks, but many sites used form validation JS libraries (e.g., jQuery Validation, FormCheck.js, Knockout Validation) to enforce a password regex.
	- **Permissive Parameters. Finally, we evaluate the prevalence of permissive parameter values for our sites, as shown in Table 5. Two widely recommended password policies are disallowing users to choose dictionary words and common breached passwords. We observe limited deployment of such password blocking though, as 72% of sites permit dictionary words as passwords and 88% allow breached passwords. Certain password structures are also often discouraged, however we detect limited prevention of these patterns as well. Approximately 71% of sites permit sequences, repeating characters, and personal identifiers (e.g., username) in passwords, and 78% allow all-digit passwords. Recent password guidelines also recommend allowing various types of characters. We observe over 30% of sites do not support spaces, Unicode, or emojis in passwords, and about 30% disallow one of the four most popular special characters (“.”, “!”, “_”, and “#”). Case Study: Accepting Popular Passwords. We assess whether sites accept popular passwords using the top four passwords in a password breach dataset . We list these passwords and their acceptance by sites across ranking ranges in Table 6: 39% of sites accepted the top password and nearly half accepted one of the top four passwords. These sites may be vulnerable to password spraying attacks as their policies permit users to choose popular passwords. We note that most restrictive parameters and password blocklisting would disallow such passwords.**
	- We observe that NIST’s 2004 guidelines have been most widely adopted, with 42.1% of sites adhering. Meanwhile, 30.8% of sites’ policies satisfy NIST 2017’s guidelines, although 16.7% of sites exhibit policies that follow NIST’s old 1985 recommendation. These results indicate the staying power of recommendations, as old NIST guidelines are still observed on most sites, even more than 5 years after updated guidelines were released. Similarly, fewer websites adhere to Germany BSI’s latest guidelines compared to older ones. Across NIST and DISA guidelines, we also observe that stronger security levels are significantly less adopted. For example, only 5.5% of sites have policies satisfying NIST 2004 Level 2, compared to 42.1% for Level 1. We also see low adoption of stricter password guidelines, such as those of US CERT, NCSC, and OWASP. Notably, these guidelines and higher security levels generally required stricter length requirements (particularly 𝐿𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 8), and checks against dictionary words and breached passwords. This suggests incentives to adopt stronger policies are ineffective and the costs of deploying these strong policy parameters are non-trivial.

	- Restrictive and Permissive Parameters. Table 5 depicts the parameter values for all three ranking ranges, showing the percent of sites within each population where a parameter value is true. We observe that overall, top sites are more likely to enforce restrictions on the password (e.g., 𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑏24 is true for 15% of top 10K sites, compared to 9% of all sites). Top sites are generally more permissive in which special characters they accept, including periods, exclamation marks, underscores, pound signs, space, and Unicode characters (although slightly fewer top sites accept emojis compared to all sites). Surprisingly, top sites also are more permissive of oft-discouraged password patterns, including dictionary words, sequential and repeated characters, and the inclusion of personal identifiers. However, top sites are significantly less likely to accept all-digit passwords, accepted by only 39-57% of top 10K sites compared to 78% of all sites. Top sites are also slightly less likely to allow breached passwords compared to all websites though (84% of the top 10K versus 88% for all). Overall, top sites apply more password composition requirements but also permit more characters/structures (except all-digit passwords).
	- Restrictive and Permissive Parameters: Few works systematically characterized restrictive and permissive parameters, with most highlighting case studies rather than comprehensive analysis. However, prior work observed between 30-50% of sites enforced several restrictive parameters. We observe a smaller fraction, with only 1.8-9.3% of sites employing any given restrictive parameter, although top-ranked sites employed restrictive parameters more. Thus when considering websites at scale, restrictive parameters are less prevalent overall. Earlier work from 2010 also found few sites performing dictionary checks. However, we observed a modest rate today, at 28% (observed 41% on top English sites).
# Novel Ways to Apply Research
- Implement and compare additional approaches to defending against password spray
	- password policies in active directory
		- Most websites don't implement good password policies, so that's a place that can immediately be improved
	- simple multi factor authentication implementation with detections
- Figure out how to accept more than one password from fake user (deception) account so that it covers a list of passwords that could be used with a password spray attack (includes breached, common, or easily guessed passwords)

I'm not sure which one of the above routes I should take.  Time to research them and document that below.

## Ideas
- Somehow have multiple credentials per user in AD
- I found research showing the issue of privacy with certain methods of password spray detection.  The gist is that in order to detect one entity using the same password over tons of systems you have to somewhat reveal the password or some version of it
- Windows AD doesn't immediately allow for multiple sets of credentials for one user account
- The issues of having conditional authentication policies
	- 2 ways to manage multiple entities or users accessing one account for various admin purposes? )
		- You could have multiple sets of credentials that can be activated or deactivated for that one account
		- You could manage those credentials in some system like a password manager and disallow access to certain individuals, which would also then require the password to be reset
- I don't understand all of the nuances of user accounts in Windows AD:
	- SPN vs UPN vs SAM vs SID
	- NTLM vs Kerberos (Windows AD) and Entra ID related authentication methods (OAuth, SAML, etc) -- Windows AD is designed for older on-prem with VPN use cases.  
- I'm assuming there isn't a way to use external third party authentication where we can have condition authentication (Identity Verification via some identity provider with the ability to setup conditional logic as an identity
	- Where passwords are stored and why only one?
## 1. Implement Alternative Defenses to Password Sprays in AD
There are lots of different ways to bolster systems against the intended consequences of passwords sprays. However, I am most interested in two defenses:
1. Password Policies in Active Directory
2. Multi-Factor Authentication with Detections in AD

### Advanced Password Policies in AD
- Fine grained password policies in Windows AD
	- [How to Create a Fine-grained Password Policy in AD | Specops Software](https://specopssoft.com/blog/create-fine-grained-password-policy-active-directory/) 
### Implementing MFA in Windows AD
- Very possible in a number of ways even directly out of the box

## 2. Multi-Password Fake User: Multiple Credentials on One User Account, Inclusive/Permissive/Flexible Factor Authentication in AD
- Figure out how to accept more than one password for fake user (deception) account so that it covers a list of passwords that could be used with a password spray attack (includes breached, common, or easily guessed passwords)
- Other terms for this could also be related to conditional authentication

The goal is to cover most of the passwords that are likely to be tried by an attacker conducting dictionary, spray, or other types password attacks on accounts.  Instead of a specific password, any one password from a list of them can be used to authenticate an account. By doing so, we can cover large groups of common passwords and make it more likely that the attacker hits these fake user account "tripwires."

### Security StackExchange Post
[active directory - Windows AD - Fake User Account with Multiple Passwords to Detect Password Spray - Information Security Stack Exchange](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/273340/windows-ad-fake-user-account-with-multiple-passwords-to-detect-password-spray)

#### Question
```markdown
# TL;DR
I'm trying to implement a fake user account that has multiple sets of credentials that can be used.  Instead of a specific password, any one password from a list of them could be used to authenticate to the account. By doing so, we can cover breached, common, or easily guessed passwords, and make it more likely that an attacker is detected through these fake user account "tripwires." This would be useful for detecting password sprays in the domain.

# FYI
I'm not familiar with Windows AD and how identities are defined with various Windows authentication methods. I'm also not intimately familiar with system administration, Azure, IAM, or devops.

# Background 
I set up a Windows AD domain from within Azure using the ARM template from [DefensiveOrigins/DO-LAB](https://github.com/DefensiveOrigins/DO-LAB).  The goal was to do some "purple teaming" by setting up a fake tripwire user account with an easy password, do a fake password spray over the domain, then implement detections using KQL in [Microsoft Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-sentinel/).

The original lab comes from here - [AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22: APT-9S22](https://github.com/AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22/tree/main)

In practice, this lab must be able to use the "DomainPasswordSpray" tool from [APT-9S22/APT/1-Labs/L0090-SprayTools](https://github.com/AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22/tree/89f10f020a4487cfe9077c9ca74a0342d5d43e59/APT/1-Labs/L0090-SprayTools) along with recon such as with BloodHound [APT-9S22/APT/1-Labs/L0050-BloodHoundAD-UI](https://github.com/AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22/tree/89f10f020a4487cfe9077c9ca74a0342d5d43e59/APT/1-Labs/L0050-BloodHoundAD-UI).

# Why a Fake User Account with Multiple Creds?
I wanted to add a twist to the fake user accounts. What if the attacker were to hit a legitimate account that has an easy password like "easypassword1" before it hits my fake account that's using "easypassword2."  This would mean that my fake user account never gets tripped.  To avoid this I thought it would be valuable if I could somehow programmatically allow for multiple passwords to get into an account.  If possible, I can plug in a list of common passwords and almost always get a hit on that account and cover a large distribution of passwords used with attacks. As a result, that one account would effectively cover password spray detections for the whole domain with little effort.

The step with Fake User Generation can be found at - [APT-9S22/APT/1-Labs/L0040-Deception - AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22](https://github.com/AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22/tree/89f10f020a4487cfe9077c9ca74a0342d5d43e59/APT/1-Labs/L0040-Deception)

ChatGPT tried to say that Credential Manager could do this, but I'm calling a GTP hallucination on that. 

## Other Mentions
Lots of people saying it's not possible or not looking at it from other perspectives.

- [Using multiple passwords with Microsoft Active Directory user account - Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/1142223/using-multiple-passwords-with-microsoft-active-directory-user-account)

# Approaches & Related Problems
These are all approaches that could maybe work for implementing this multi-credential fake user account (even if only logical and not literal).

## Multiple entities on one account
There are lots of cases where you may have multiple entities or people accessing one privileged account.  

There's a Microsoft article related to this for Entra ID ([Sharing accounts and credentials | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/users-sharing-accounts)).  

I can think of 2 ways this can be done:
 1. Multiple sets of credentials that can be activated or deactivated for that one account
 2. You could manage those credentials in some system like a password manager and disallow access when necessary, which would also then require the password to be reset

I'm unaware of nuanced ways accounts can be used in Windows AD. Maybe there's a type of logical account in Windows AD that can be a sort of account proxy to the main account. 

## External/Third-Party Identity Provider (Proxy for Authentication)
Maybe there's a way to implement some sort of external identity provider that could use conditional logic with forms of identification (what you know, what you are, what you have.) For example, a password could be attempted in Windows AD, then that password is sent to the 3rd party, then the identity provider would check through its list of password (PW1 OR PW2...) and return true.  Is this a thing? Is it possible?

#### Comments & Answers
- `What if the attacker were to hit a legitimate account that has an easy password like "easypassword1" before it hits my fake account that's using "easypassword2."` that's an easy problem to prevent though. Filtering out insecure passwords at time of change and searching an AD database for bad/easy passwords, both easy and minimal effort. To the extent it isn't explainable on a modern day audit if those problems exist.
- Me: 
	- @GregAskew It's not a bad point. I'm also showing how password policies and MFA are the defenses in this project. However, the multiple password implementation still would have the purpose of detecting malicious users that have a foothold in the system and are trying to escalate privileges.
- Frame challenge: does the password for this account even matter? If you create an account with a name that's attractive to attackers (or likely to be found by then) that's never used by any of your systems, then _any_ login attempt against it is a red flag that should be investigated.
- Me: 
	- Honestly...not sure. I've seen tons of false positives before in enterprise systems for all sorts of reasons. It's true that such activity on a consistent system could automatically be flagged as malicious. I wonder if there are legitimate reasons, services, or scripts that are ran on AD that result in false positives in such a case. In my environment, surely not, but maybe in others. Such a detection wouldn't target a password spray then, but it's useful nonetheless.

### Asking Coworkers
- Coworker said they only know of one account, but it only stores the other most recent hash and this doesn't apply here
	- Yeah, I don't see that as possible directly with AD. The only account I know of that will have 2 valid hashes, is the krbtgt account. And that's only because it remembers the last password and will accept it. I think that's an anti-lockout measure. So you would probably need middleware.
	- Me: I figured as much. I'm just no familiar enough with IAM or the inner workings of AD to know how that middleware is integrated. May have to be theoretical for this part of the project.
