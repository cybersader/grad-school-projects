## Password Spraying
- (Prior Work to Next Paper) [Gossamer: Securely Measuring Password-based Logins | USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/sanusi-bohuk) 
	- "a new login service instrumentation tool called Gossamer. It securely records information about login requests, including certain carefully chosen statistics about the passwords used in the requests"
- [Araña: Discovering and Characterizing Password Guessing Attacks in Practice | USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/islam) 
	- "Understanding and characterizing attacker strategies is critical to improving security, but doing so has been challenging thus far due to the sensitivity of login services and the lack of ground truth labels for benign and malicious login requests."
	- "Gossamer was deployed for seven months at one university (U1) and three months at another (U2)"
	- "Even with the measurements provided by Gossamer, discovering attacks represents a tricky bootstrapping problem. The compromise logs do not implicate specific login requests and, more broadly, there is no ground truth anywhere in the dataset for attacks. This makes the supervised machine learning approaches used in prior work inapplicable to our setting."
	- "We develop a new analysis pipeline that we call Araña. Crucially, it focuses not on individual requests but sets of login requests emanating from the same IP within a day. This ensures sufficient signal about client behavior for patterns to emerge. We then built an application-specific filtering, clustering, and manual analysis approach. We filter out likely-benign login request sets using custom heuristics, such as filtering out IP addresses exhibiting high login success rates."
	- "We then use an unsupervised learning approach, specifically agglomerative clustering, with a custom distance function tailored to login sets. This helps us identify clusters of login sets that can be manually analyzed with little effort to discover attack campaigns—sets of login requests likely to be submitted by the same attacker."
	- "We use it to discover and characterize a diverse set of 29 attack clusters. Many are high volume credential stuffing attacks that submit on average one password per targeted username and exhibit a notable fraction of username-password pairs appearing in breaches. In addition to the more simplistic stuffing attacks that quickly flood requests from a handful of IP addresses, Araña allowed for discovering widely distributed attacks that may originate from hundreds of different IP addresses. Some of these attacks try to be “low and slow”, submitting a low number of requests per day at a slow rate. This confirms that credential stuffing attackers attempt to evade countermeasures that focus on individual high volume IPs. These credential stuffing attacks are unfortunately effective: We uncover hundreds of potential successful logins by attackers for usernames not flagged already in compromise reports prepared by security engineers."
	- "We are also able to discover lower volume, targeted attacks by focusing on Araña-identified clusters that exhibit a large number of requests to individual usernames. For example, we identified an attack campaign made up of two clusters that targeted 127 users with on average 25 guessed passwords per user. These attacks included successful logins, suggesting this targeted strategy can also work for attackers."
	- "We discuss many other attack campaigns in the body. Overall, our analyses highlight a number of important takeaways for authentication system designers. First, they suggest that, perhaps unsurprisingly, credential stuffing attacks remain a primary vector for account compromise. This, plus the fact that most compromised users in our study also had passwords in known breaches, underscores the urgent need for broader use of breach alerting APIs (e.g.)."
	- **"Researchers have also developed natural language processing techniques to improve guess generation"**
	- **"Credential stuffing is one kind of online guessing attack— an attack that remotely attempts to log into a service with guessed credentials. Other examples of guessing attacks include password spraying attacks that submit a few very popular passwords against a large number of user accounts and credential tweaking attacks that submit slight variants of breached passwords"**

- [[2309.03384] Measuring Website Password Creation Policies At Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03384)
	- "To date, there has been limited investigation into what password creation policies are actually deployed by sites. Existing works are mostly dated and all studies relied on manual evaluations, assessing a small set of sites (at most 150, skewed towards top sites). Thus, we lack a broad understanding of the password policies used today. In this paper, we develop an automated technique for inferring a website’s password creation policy, and apply it at scale to measure the policies of over 20K sites, over two orders of magnitude (∼135x) more sites than prior work."
	- "Passwords remain the de facto standard method for online authentication"
	- "To date, there has been significantly less investigation into how website operators actually manage password authentication and what password creation policies they enforce. A handful of studies have manually analyzed the password policies of top websites. However, due to the manual methods used in this prior work, the scale of investigation is heavily limited, with the largest entailing only 150 websites. The considered website populations also skew towards highly-ranked sites, across a few countries (i.e., US, Germany, and China). Furthermore, most studies were conducted over a decade ago, predating significant updates to password guidelines, including those by NIST and Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). Thus, we lack a large-scale modern understanding of the password creation policies deployed by sites today, the authentication security and usability implications of these policies, and the adoption rate of authentication recommendations."
	- "In this work, we seek to close this gap. Given the incredible diversity of the web, doing so is challenging, as websites and their password authentication are implemented in a myriad of ways, and password policy information is often not explicitly published. In this work, we develop a web measurement method that automatically infers password creation policies in a blackbox fashion"

In this work, we develop a web measurement method that automatically infers password creation policies in a blackbox fashion"
	- **"We find that the most common policies today enforce few requirements on passwords, aligning with recent policy recommendations (e.g., NIST’s 2017 guidelines). However, counter to modern standards, acceptance of short passwords is widespread, with over half of sites allowing passwords of six characters or shorter, and an unexpected 12% lacking any minimum length requirements. Furthermore, 30% of sites do not support certain recommended characters in passwords, including spaces and special characters. We also observe only about 12% of sites using password blocklists, resulting in the majority of sites being vulnerable to password spraying attacks"**
	- "We also observe that top-ranked sites tend to support stronger policy parameters. Through case studies of weak policy parameters, we identify how web frameworks and default configurations may be driving factors."
	- Various password params used when analyzing password policies:
		- Lengths
			- overall length
		- Restrictive
			- digits, upper, lower, special, combinations
			- letter strat
		- Permissive - allowing certain characteristics without requiring them
			- dictionary words permitted within password where a word is at least 3 letters
			- sequential characters - logical sequences of 3+ characters permitted in the password
			- repeated characters - 3+ repeated characters
			- long digit pws
			- short digit pws
			- personal information/identifiers - personal info in the password
			- space - whitespaces
			- emojis
			- unicode letters
			- Popular Special Symbols - allows one of top 4 special symbols in the password
			- Breached Passwords - a common password from a known password leak is permitted
	- 2) Permitted Sequences (𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑝 , 𝑃𝑠𝑒𝑞 , 𝑃𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡, 𝑃𝑖𝑑 ): Here, we construct a password with the evaluated sequence and test for acceptance. For repeated characters (𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑝 ) the sequence is three repeating consecutive characters (e.g., 111, aaa, or AAA), and for sequential characters (𝑃𝑠𝑒𝑞) it is abc, 123, or ABC. For both parameters, we select one as permitted by other policy parameters. For dictionary words (𝑃𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡), we identify the longest word (up to 8 characters) permitted in a password as constrained by other policy parameters, and test the inclusion of the most common English word. For personal identifiers (𝑃𝑖𝑑 ), the evaluated sequence is a subset of the username used during account creation. We choose our usernames to be a 3-letter names followed by 5 random digits, and the sequence is the 3-letter portion of the username (e.g. if the registered username is joe31426, we evaluate the acceptance of the sequence "joe" in the password)
	- 4) Breached Passwords (𝑃𝑏𝑟): With other parameters determined, we test the highest-ranked breached password satisfying them (e.g. if 𝐷𝐼𝐺𝑚𝑖𝑛 ≥ 1, 𝑅𝑙𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 = 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒, 𝐿𝑚𝑖𝑛 ≥ 6, all other restrictive parameters are false and permissive parameters are true, Attempted Password: 123456, the most popular password in satisfying policy parameters). If accepted, 𝑃𝑏𝑟 = 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒, otherwise true.
	- Testing websites:
		- Out of the 1M domains, we find signup pages on 141K domains (14.12%). While we could successfully submit one signup attempt (including CAPTCHA solving) on 59K domains, we were able to fully evaluate (across multiple attempts) 26K domains. Finally, we filter out domains where all signup attempts are reported as successes or failures (as this is not feasible, especially with our sanity check signup attempt), or where all trailing attempts are failures (we test permissive parameters last, and as discussed shortly, it is highly unlikely that any site truly does not permit all tested characters/structures). This filtering leaves us with 20,119 domains for which we successfully analyze password policies. We manually validated our results are accurate on a random sample of 100 evaluated sites. We note that this population is two orders of magnitude larger than prior work (as discussed in Section 2), 
	- Our analyzed sites are also broadly distributed across rankings (unlike prior work’s focus on top sites)
	- Surprisingly, the most popular policy (8.3% of sites) allowed passwords of any length without any constraints. . In addition, 5 top policies also cap the password’s length (including one that limits passwords to only 20 characters). Other password constraints are less prominent in top policies, with only 4 of the top 15 policies applying any non-length constraints. Most policies appear on only one site, which highlights enormous diversity in the policies deployed (with implications for guidelines, password usability, and password managers, as will be discussed in Section 6).  As the top 15 policies (Section 4.2) capture only a third of our sites
	- Case Study: Required Word Structure and Letter Start. We manually investigated 100 domains requiring a two-word structure as well as domains enforcing letter start, confirming our inference. We did not identify common platforms or frameworks, but many sites used form validation JS libraries (e.g., jQuery Validation, FormCheck.js, Knockout Validation) to enforce a password regex.
	- **Permissive Parameters. Finally, we evaluate the prevalence of permissive parameter values for our sites, as shown in Table 5. Two widely recommended password policies are disallowing users to choose dictionary words and common breached passwords. We observe limited deployment of such password blocking though, as 72% of sites permit dictionary words as passwords and 88% allow breached passwords. Certain password structures are also often discouraged, however we detect limited prevention of these patterns as well. Approximately 71% of sites permit sequences, repeating characters, and personal identifiers (e.g., username) in passwords, and 78% allow all-digit passwords. Recent password guidelines also recommend allowing various types of characters. We observe over 30% of sites do not support spaces, Unicode, or emojis in passwords, and about 30% disallow one of the four most popular special characters (“.”, “!”, “_”, and “#”). Case Study: Accepting Popular Passwords. We assess whether sites accept popular passwords using the top four passwords in a password breach dataset . We list these passwords and their acceptance by sites across ranking ranges in Table 6: 39% of sites accepted the top password and nearly half accepted one of the top four passwords. These sites may be vulnerable to password spraying attacks as their policies permit users to choose popular passwords. We note that most restrictive parameters and password blocklisting would disallow such passwords.**
	- We observe that NIST’s 2004 guidelines have been most widely adopted, with 42.1% of sites adhering. Meanwhile, 30.8% of sites’ policies satisfy NIST 2017’s guidelines, although 16.7% of sites exhibit policies that follow NIST’s old 1985 recommendation. These results indicate the staying power of recommendations, as old NIST guidelines are still observed on most sites, even more than 5 years after updated guidelines were released. Similarly, fewer websites adhere to Germany BSI’s latest guidelines compared to older ones. Across NIST and DISA guidelines, we also observe that stronger security levels are significantly less adopted. For example, only 5.5% of sites have policies satisfying NIST 2004 Level 2, compared to 42.1% for Level 1. We also see low adoption of stricter password guidelines, such as those of US CERT, NCSC, and OWASP. Notably, these guidelines and higher security levels generally required stricter length requirements (particularly 𝐿𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 8), and checks against dictionary words and breached passwords. This suggests incentives to adopt stronger policies are ineffective and the costs of deploying these strong policy parameters are non-trivial.

	- ![](IMG-20231121234338619.png)
	- Restrictive and Permissive Parameters. Table 5 depicts the parameter values for all three ranking ranges, showing the percent of sites within each population where a parameter value is true. We observe that overall, top sites are more likely to enforce restrictions on the password (e.g., 𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑏24 is true for 15% of top 10K sites, compared to 9% of all sites). Top sites are generally more permissive in which special characters they accept, including periods, exclamation marks, underscores, pound signs, space, and Unicode characters (although slightly fewer top sites accept emojis compared to all sites). Surprisingly, top sites also are more permissive of oft-discouraged password patterns, including dictionary words, sequential and repeated characters, and the inclusion of personal identifiers. However, top sites are significantly less likely to accept all-digit passwords, accepted by only 39-57% of top 10K sites compared to 78% of all sites. Top sites are also slightly less likely to allow breached passwords compared to all websites though (84% of the top 10K versus 88% for all). Overall, top sites apply more password composition requirements but also permit more characters/structures (except all-digit passwords).
	- Restrictive and Permissive Parameters: Few works systematically characterized restrictive and permissive parameters, with most highlighting case studies rather than comprehensive analysis. However, prior work observed between 30-50% of sites enforced several restrictive parameters. We observe a smaller fraction, with only 1.8-9.3% of sites employing any given restrictive parameter, although top-ranked sites employed restrictive parameters more. Thus when considering websites at scale, restrictive parameters are less prevalent overall. Earlier work from 2010 also found few sites performing dictionary checks. However, we observed a modest rate today, at 28% (observed 41% on top English sites).
# Novel Ideas & Research Application
- Implement and compare additional approaches to defending against password spray
	- password policies in active directory
		- Most websites don't implement good password policies, so that's a place that can immediately be improved
	- simple multi factor authentication implementation with detections
- Figure out how to accept more than one password from fake user (deception) account so that it covers a list of passwords that could be used with a password spray attack (includes breached, common, or easily guessed passwords)

I'm not sure which one of the above routes I should take.  Time to research them and document that below.

## Ideas
- Somehow have multiple credentials per user in AD
- I found research showing the issue of privacy with certain methods of password spray detection.  The gist is that in order to detect one entity using the same password over tons of systems you have to somewhat reveal the password or some version of it
- Windows AD doesn't immediately allow for multiple sets of credentials for one user account
- The issues of having conditional authentication policies
	- 2 ways to manage multiple entities or users accessing one account for various admin purposes? )
		- You could have multiple sets of credentials that can be activated or deactivated for that one account
		- You could manage those credentials in some system like a password manager and disallow access to certain individuals, which would also then require the password to be reset
- I don't understand all of the nuances of user accounts in Windows AD:
	- SPN vs UPN vs SAM vs SID
	- NTLM vs Kerberos (Windows AD) and Entra ID related authentication methods (OAuth, SAML, etc) -- Windows AD is designed for older on-prem with VPN use cases.  
- I'm assuming there isn't a way to use external third party authentication where we can have condition authentication (Identity Verification via some identity provider with the ability to setup conditional logic as an identity
	- Where passwords are stored and why only one?
## 1. Implement Alternative Defenses to Password Sprays in AD
There are lots of different ways to bolster systems against the intended consequences of passwords sprays. However, I am most interested in two defenses:
1. Password Policies in Active Directory
2. Multi-Factor Authentication with Detections in AD

### Advanced Password Policies in AD
- Fine grained password policies in Windows AD

	- [How To Configure a Domain Password Policy - Active Directory Pro](https://activedirectorypro.com/how-to-configure-a-domain-password-policy/)
### Implementing MFA in Windows AD
- Very possible in a number of ways even directly out of the box

## 2. Multi-Password Fake User: Multiple Credentials on One User Account, Inclusive/Permissive/Flexible Factor Authentication in AD
- Figure out how to accept more than one password for fake user (deception) account so that it covers a list of passwords that could be used with a password spray attack (includes breached, common, or easily guessed passwords)
- Other terms for this could also be related to conditional authentication

The goal is to cover most of the passwords that are likely to be tried by an attacker conducting dictionary, spray, or other types password attacks on accounts.  Instead of a specific password, any one password from a list of them can be used to authenticate an account. By doing so, we can cover large groups of common passwords and make it more likely that the attacker hits these fake user account "tripwires."

#### Question

```
# TL;DR
I'm trying to implement a fake user account that has multiple sets of credentials that can be used.  Instead of a specific password, any one password from a list of them could be used to authenticate to the account. By doing so, we can cover breached, common, or easily guessed passwords, and make it more likely that an attacker is detected through these fake user account "tripwires." This would be useful for detecting password sprays in the domain.

# FYI
I'm not familiar with Windows AD and how identities are defined with various Windows authentication methods. I'm also not intimately familiar with system administration, Azure, IAM, or devops.

# Background 
I set up a Windows AD domain from within Azure using the ARM template from [DefensiveOrigins/DO-LAB](https://github.com/DefensiveOrigins/DO-LAB).  The goal was to do some "purple teaming" by setting up a fake tripwire user account with an easy password, do a fake password spray over the domain, then implement detections using KQL in [Microsoft Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-sentinel/).

The original lab comes from here - [AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22: APT-9S22](https://github.com/AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22/tree/main)

In practice, this lab must be able to use the "DomainPasswordSpray" tool from [APT-9S22/APT/1-Labs/L0090-SprayTools](https://github.com/AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22/tree/89f10f020a4487cfe9077c9ca74a0342d5d43e59/APT/1-Labs/L0090-SprayTools) along with recon such as with BloodHound [APT-9S22/APT/1-Labs/L0050-BloodHoundAD-UI](https://github.com/AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22/tree/89f10f020a4487cfe9077c9ca74a0342d5d43e59/APT/1-Labs/L0050-BloodHoundAD-UI).

# Why a Fake User Account with Multiple Creds?
I wanted to add a twist to the fake user accounts. What if the attacker were to hit a legitimate account that has an easy password like "easypassword1" before it hits my fake account that's using "easypassword2."  This would mean that my fake user account never gets tripped.  To avoid this I thought it would be valuable if I could somehow programmatically allow for multiple passwords to get into an account.  If possible, I can plug in a list of common passwords and almost always get a hit on that account and cover a large distribution of passwords used with attacks. As a result, that one account would effectively cover password spray detections for the whole domain with little effort.

The step with Fake User Generation can be found at - [APT-9S22/APT/1-Labs/L0040-Deception - AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22](https://github.com/AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22/tree/89f10f020a4487cfe9077c9ca74a0342d5d43e59/APT/1-Labs/L0040-Deception)

ChatGPT tried to say that Credential Manager could do this, but I'm calling a GTP hallucination on that. 

## Other Mentions
Lots of people saying it's not possible or not looking at it from other perspectives.

- [Using multiple passwords with Microsoft Active Directory user account - Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/1142223/using-multiple-passwords-with-microsoft-active-directory-user-account)

# Approaches & Related Problems
These are all approaches that could maybe work for implementing this multi-credential fake user account (even if only logical and not literal).

## Multiple entities on one account
There are lots of cases where you may have multiple entities or people accessing one privileged account.  

There's a Microsoft article related to this for Entra ID ([Sharing accounts and credentials | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/users-sharing-accounts)).  

I can think of 2 ways this can be done:
 1. Multiple sets of credentials that can be activated or deactivated for that one account
 2. You could manage those credentials in some system like a password manager and disallow access when necessary, which would also then require the password to be reset

I'm unaware of nuanced ways accounts can be used in Windows AD. Maybe there's a type of logical account in Windows AD that can be a sort of account proxy to the main account. 

## External/Third-Party Identity Provider (Proxy for Authentication)
Maybe there's a way to implement some sort of external identity provider that could use conditional logic with forms of identification (what you know, what you are, what you have.) For example, a password could be attempted in Windows AD, then that password is sent to the 3rd party, then the identity provider would check through its list of password (PW1 OR PW2...) and return true.  Is this a thing? Is it possible?

#### Comments & Answers
- `What if the attacker were to hit a legitimate account that has an easy password like "easypassword1" before it hits my fake account that's using "easypassword2."` that's an easy problem to prevent though. Filtering out insecure passwords at time of change and searching an AD database for bad/easy passwords, both easy and minimal effort. To the extent it isn't explainable on a modern day audit if those problems exist.
- Me: 
	- @GregAskew It's not a bad point. I'm also showing how password policies and MFA are the defenses in this project. However, the multiple password implementation still would have the purpose of detecting malicious users that have a foothold in the system and are trying to escalate privileges.
- Frame challenge: does the password for this account even matter? If you create an account with a name that's attractive to attackers (or likely to be found by then) that's never used by any of your systems, then _any_ login attempt against it is a red flag that should be investigated.
- Me: 
	- Honestly...not sure. I've seen tons of false positives before in enterprise systems for all sorts of reasons. It's true that such activity on a consistent system could automatically be flagged as malicious. I wonder if there are legitimate reasons, services, or scripts that are ran on AD that result in false positives in such a case. In my environment, surely not, but maybe in others. Such a detection wouldn't target a password spray then, but it's useful nonetheless.

### Asking Coworkers
- Coworker said they only know of one account, but it only stores the other most recent hash and this doesn't apply here
	- Yeah, I don't see that as possible directly with AD. The only account I know of that will have 2 valid hashes, is the krbtgt account. And that's only because it remembers the last password and will accept it. I think that's an anti-lockout measure. So you would probably need middleware.
	- Me: I figured as much. I'm just no familiar enough with IAM or the inner workings of AD to know how that middleware is integrated. May have to be theoretical for this part of the project.

### Third Parties to Conditionally Authenticate with AD

#### Conditional Authentication via 3rd Party (the idea)
- I wonder what sort of middleware options I have for implementing condtiional authentication from a 3rd party for AD?
- The idea is to input a list of common passwords into the external authenticator, then it checks to see if the password is one of those common passwords.  This would be on a decoy user account and detect password sprays.  However, I'm not sure if every account or user SID needs a hash associated with them
#### Conditional Authentication (ChatGPT convo)
Are there any open source technologies that could be used to authenticate with active directory via some sort of plugin but also allow for conditional authentication such as multiple passwords per user account?

ChatGPT:
```
Yes, there are open-source technologies that can be used to authenticate with Active Directory and support conditional authentication. One such solution is FreeRADIUS, an open-source RADIUS server. FreeRADIUS can be extended using various plugins, and there are modules available to integrate it with Active Directory for authentication.

For conditional authentication, you might need to customize the configuration to implement specific policies. FreeRADIUS has a flexible and extensible architecture, allowing you to add custom logic and policies to meet your authentication requirements, including the possibility of implementing multiple passwords per user account.

Keep in mind that integrating and configuring such solutions may require expertise in both Active Directory and the chosen open-source technology.
```

other than asswords what are other forms of authentication in active directory

ChatGPT:
```
In addition to passwords, Active Directory supports various forms of authentication and security mechanisms. Some of these include:

1. **Smart Cards:** Users can authenticate using smart cards, which are credit card-sized cards containing an integrated circuit chip. The chip holds a user's private key, and the smart card is used in conjunction with a PIN for authentication.
    
2. **Biometric Authentication:** Active Directory can integrate with biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint recognition or retina scans, providing an additional layer of security based on unique physical characteristics.
    
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA requires users to provide two or more forms of authentication before granting access. This could include a combination of something the user knows (password), something the user has (smart card), or something the user is (biometric data).
    
4. **Certificate-based Authentication:** Users can authenticate using digital certificates, which are cryptographic keys issued by a Certificate Authority (CA). This method often involves Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for certificate management.
    
5. **Kerberos Authentication:** Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that uses tickets to prove the identity of users. Active Directory uses Kerberos as its default authentication protocol.
    
6. **One-Time Passwords (OTP):** Users receive a one-time code through a separate device or app, and this code is used in conjunction with their regular credentials for authentication.
    

Integrating these authentication methods often provides enhanced security by requiring attackers to compromise multiple factors to gain unauthorized access.
```

Are there ways to authenticate to active directory via a third party integration with conditional authentication methods like accepting any inputted password from a list of stored hashes or something

ChatGPT:
```
While it's possible to implement conditional authentication methods, such as accepting any inputted password from a list of stored hashes, directly within Active Directory, it's important to note that such customization may not be straightforward and could introduce security risks if not implemented carefully. Directly manipulating authentication mechanisms in Active Directory is typically discouraged to maintain the system's integrity and security.

Instead, a more common approach is to use identity and access management solutions or third-party authentication systems that integrate with Active Directory. These systems often provide the flexibility to implement custom authentication policies, including conditional authentication based on various factors.

Here are some general steps you might consider:

1. **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Solutions:** Look into IAM solutions that offer advanced authentication features. These solutions often provide a layer of abstraction, allowing you to implement custom authentication policies without directly modifying Active Directory.
    
2. **Custom Authentication Plugins:** Some IAM solutions or authentication frameworks allow you to develop custom plugins or extensions. You could create a custom plugin to handle conditional authentication based on your specific requirements.
    
3. **Federation Services:** Implementing federation services like Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) can also provide additional options for authentication policies and integrations with third-party identity providers.
    
4. **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML):** If your third-party solution supports SAML, you can use it to establish trust and enable single sign-on (SSO) between your application and Active Directory.
    

Always keep security in mind when implementing custom authentication methods, and thoroughly test any changes in a controlled environment before applying them to a production system. Additionally, consult the documentation of the specific IAM or authentication solution you choose for detailed guidance on customization and integration with Active Directory.
```

Why is active directory necessary?

```
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft, and its necessity stems from its role in providing centralized management and authentication services within a networked environment. Here are several reasons why Active Directory is considered necessary in many organizations:

1. **Centralized Authentication and Authorization:** Active Directory serves as a centralized repository for user accounts, enabling users to log in with a single set of credentials. It also manages access permissions to network resources based on user roles and groups.
    
2. **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Users can access various services and resources within the network without needing separate credentials for each. This enhances user experience and simplifies password management.
    
3. **Group Policy Management:** Active Directory allows administrators to enforce policies across the network, ensuring consistent security settings, software deployments, and configurations for all connected devices.
    
4. **Resource Management:** It provides a structured way to organize and manage network resources such as computers, printers, and applications. This simplifies the process of locating and accessing these resources.
    
5. **Security and Access Control:** Active Directory offers robust security features, including the ability to implement access controls and permissions. It helps in securing sensitive data and resources by controlling who can access what.
    
6. **Integration with Microsoft Services:** Active Directory integrates seamlessly with various Microsoft services and products, such as Exchange Server, SharePoint, and Microsoft 365, providing a cohesive ecosystem for organizations heavily invested in Microsoft technologies.
    
7. **Scalability:** Active Directory is designed to scale with the growth of an organization. It can handle a large number of users, devices, and resources, making it suitable for both small businesses and large enterprises.
    
8. **Directory Replication:** Active Directory supports directory replication, ensuring that changes made on one domain controller are synchronized with others. This enhances fault tolerance and availability.
    
9. **Simplified IT Management:** Centralized management through Active Directory streamlines IT administration tasks. Administrators can efficiently manage user accounts, security policies, and network resources from a single console.
    
10. **Auditing and Logging:** Active Directory provides tools for auditing and logging, enabling organizations to track user activities, changes to security settings, and other events for compliance and security monitoring.
    

In summary, Active Directory is necessary for organizations seeking efficient user management, centralized authentication, and seamless integration with Microsoft services. It plays a crucial role in ensuring security, simplifying administration, and providing a foundation for a well-organized and scalable IT infrastructure.
```

Do user account SIDs in AD ever not have a password associated with them but rather use some other form of authentication such as a third party identity provider

ChatGPT:
```
In Active Directory, a Security Identifier (SID) uniquely identifies a security principal such as a user, group, or computer within a Windows environment. SIDs themselves don't have passwords associated with them; instead, they are used in conjunction with authentication mechanisms like passwords, certificates, or other forms of authentication.

When it comes to user accounts, Active Directory typically relies on passwords for authentication. However, in scenarios where organizations use third-party identity providers or implement Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions, the authentication process may involve mechanisms other than a traditional Active Directory password.

For example:

1. **Federation Services:** Organizations might implement federation services like Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to enable Single Sign-On across different systems. In such cases, a user may authenticate through another identity provider, and the authentication token is trusted by Active Directory.
    
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** While still involving a password, the authentication process can be enhanced with additional factors like a one-time code from a mobile app, biometric data, or a hardware token.
    
3. **External Identity Providers:** Some organizations leverage external identity providers (IdPs) such as Azure Active Directory, Okta, or other third-party solutions. Users authenticate with these services, and the authentication information is trusted by Active Directory.
    

In these scenarios, while SIDs still uniquely identify users within Active Directory, the authentication process may involve external systems or additional factors beyond just a password associated with the AD user account. The specifics depend on the organization's chosen identity and authentication architecture.

### Inclusive Hashing
#### Inclusive Hashing (my idea)
- It would be cool if you could prove deterministically with some algorithm that some password relates to some big hash like "PASSW_1 OR PASSW_2 == HASH"
- I'm assuming that the hash or whatever object would need to be larger depending on the number of inputs
- This wouldn't be something to typically use for authentication, but rather on the backend for certain use cases such as covering a large number of passwords for cyber deception
- It's possible that this algorithm could be assumed by an attacker if the authentication process takes longer than usual though
#### Inclusive Hashing (ChatGPT)
Is there hashing that can be hierarchical or inclusive in nature? For instance, is there some way to have one big hash that can deterministacally represent more than one input or accept more than one. This may not be hashing, but I'm wondering if there's a cryptography concept that acts like this.

I'm asking if there is a way to have one ultimate hash or some sort of cryptgraphic object that can be compared to only one of many select inputs and still be verified. The use cases I'm talking about are for being able to accept one of many potential passwords in cases where users can use a password from a list of passwords to login. This would ultimately come down to taking the inputted password, doing some computation on it or algorithm, then comparing it to the master hash in the database. I'm just wondering if there is an algorithm for this.

I'm talking about something that would work like below ALGORITHM(PW1 OR PW2 OR PW3) == VALUE_STORED_IN_DB This would be an exclusive OR type situation where you don't need all of the passwords to authenticate - only one of them.

If you want an authentication system where any one of multiple passwords can be used to log in, you could consider using a scheme based on the concept of a keyed hash or a message authentication code (MAC). However, it's important to note that security is a delicate matter, and designing custom authentication schemes can introduce risks. It's generally recommended to use well-established and thoroughly-reviewed authentication methods.

Here's a conceptual example:

1. **Keyed Hash or HMAC:** You could use a keyed hash function or an HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) with a secret key. The idea is to combine each potential password with the secret key and store the result in the database.
```python
import hashlib
import hmac

# Secret key (should be kept secret)
secret_key = b'SomeSecretKey'

# Potential passwords
passwords = ['PW1', 'PW2', 'PW3']

# Calculate the hash for each potential password
hashed_passwords = [hmac.new(secret_key, password.encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256).digest() for password in passwords]

# Store hashed_passwords in the database
```

2. **Login Verification:**
```python
entered_password = 'PW2'  # Password entered by the user during login

# Calculate the hash for the entered password
entered_password_hash = hmac.new(secret_key, entered_password.encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256).digest()

# Compare entered_password_hash with the stored hashed_passwords
if entered_password_hash in hashed_passwords:
    print("Login successful")
else:
    print("Login failed")
```

This way, any one of the potential passwords (`PW1`, `PW2`, or `PW3`) would allow the user to log in. However, it's crucial to keep the secret key well-protected, and you should be aware that the security of this approach depends on the strength of the hashing algorithm and the secrecy of the key.

It's worth mentioning that in practice, using well-established authentication methods (like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2) is recommended, as these have undergone extensive security analysis and are designed to resist various attacks. If you have specific use-case requirements, consider seeking guidance from a security professional.

Is there anything where the stored master hash or conceptual object has a very large size to allow for all that information, then there's an inclusive hashing algorithm that can compare the two?

Chatgpt:
```
Creating a single hash that somehow represents multiple potential passwords in an inclusive way isn't a common practice in traditional cryptographic authentication. The usual approach is to securely store individual hashed versions of passwords using strong, well-established hashing algorithms, and then compare the entered password against the stored hash.

While you might theoretically create a large hash that includes information about multiple potential passwords, this could introduce security risks and wouldn't be a recommended approach. It might also make it easier for attackers to discover patterns or relationships between passwords.

In a secure authentication system, each password should be individually hashed with a unique salt and stored securely. The comparison during authentication is typically done by checking the entered password against the stored hash for that specific password. This way, even if one password is compromised, the others remain secure.

If you have specific reasons for needing a more complex authentication scheme, it's highly advisable to consult with security experts or use established authentication methods designed and vetted for security. Cryptography is a complex field, and designing custom solutions without expertise can lead to vulnerabilities.
```

Is this maybe possible with some sort of system based on polynomials?

ChatGPT:
```
If you're interested in a system that involves polynomials, you might want to explore the concept of polynomial-based secret sharing, specifically Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. While it's not a direct solution to your original question, it allows for a form of distributed trust where multiple pieces of information (shares) can be combined to reconstruct a secret.

In Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, a secret is divided into multiple shares, and a polynomial is used to generate these shares. The secret can be reconstructed only if a sufficient number of shares are combined. This is often used in cryptographic key management, not necessarily for password authentication, but the idea of using polynomials to distribute trust is present.

However, in the context of password authentication, this introduces complexity and may not align with the standard practices for securely storing and verifying passwords. It's important to note that password hashing and authentication schemes are designed to be straightforward, secure, and resistant to various attacks. Introducing overly complex systems, especially those not widely adopted or vetted, can introduce risks.

If you're dealing with a scenario where multiple passwords can be used interchangeably, you might want to reconsider the design and possibly focus on using well-established practices for password storage and authentication. If you have specific security or usability requirements, it would be best to consult with security professionals to ensure that any proposed solution is robust and secure.
```
#### Conditional Authentication
- It would be really cool if there were conditional authentication somehow with cryptography just like authorization with permission hierarchies works.  Not sure if this could be possible.

		- Quality assurance and situational awareness are important areas of interest for CSIRTs and security teams. Significant efforts have been made on defining metrics measuring critical parameters for these fields of application. However, methodical approaches are missing or lacking precision to enable a reliable usage of such metrics for quality assurance and situational awareness.In this contribution, we introduce a method that generalizes the application of ARIMA time series analysis on a well-defined set of metrics (ARIMA supplemented metrics) to facilitate and support quality assurance and situational awareness services. This method is based on research on ARIMA models and metrics and builds on CSIRT best practices. We show how data analysts and security practitioners can incorporate this method into existing best practices for CSIRT services pertaining to quality assurance and situational awareness. The applicability of this method is demonstrated by integrating ARIMA supplemented metrics into exemplary processes for quality assurance and situational awareness to support data analysts and security practitioners in CSIRTs and security teams.

			- Specifically, SARIMA analyzes a time series by adopting a sliding window approach: All data points within a given time window are considered by SARIMA to predict a “future” value, which is provided alongside a confidence range. We provide an example of SARIMA in Figure 14, showing the time series of the transmitted packets aggregated in time slots of 5 minutes, over a period of 1 week; the sliding window considered by SARIMA is of 30 minutes. The actual values are reported in dark blue, whereas the values predicted via SARIMA are shown in orange; the confidence window of each predicted value is shown in light blue: therefore, actual values that fall outside of this range are treated as anomalous. In particular, vertical gray lines denote the anomalies detected by SARIMA. From Figure 14, we observe that SARIMA accurately detects stationary deviations. However, SARIMA can only detect non-stationary changes when they happen within its sliding window. Furthermore, non-stationary (but legitimate) changes that occur after a long stationary interval are falsely detected as anomalies by SARIMA. Despite some incorrect predictions, the considered application of SARIMA obtained a performance that was deemed appropriate for the given task and integrated in CAIAC.

		- 2) STATISTICAL MODEL To mathematically analyze time-series data, we can generate a statistical model by calculating statistical measures, such as mean, variance, median, quantile, kurtosis, skewness, and many more. With the generated model, newly added timeseries data can be inspected to determine whether it belongs to the normal boundary
		- 4) PREDICTIVE MODEL Predictive models are used to forecast future states based on the past and current states. We can deduce the anomaly according to the severity of the discrepancy between the predicted value and the real one. For example, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)  are frequently employed models to forecast time series. ARIMA model is composed of three parts.
		- As described in (9), each value at a specific time step is affected by previous observations and prediction errors, so the ARIMA models the temporality of time series.
		- Also, the differencing process makes the time series stationary, resulting in the ARIMA being effective for non-stationary time series. If the time-series data has a seasonal- or cyclic- variation, we can use a seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. In this case, we introduce additional parameters: P, D, and Q, which deal with the seasonality. These parameters are used in the same manner as p, d, and q. Fundamentally, ARIMA is not capable of modeling multivariate data. Instead, autoregressive integrated moving average exogenous (ARIMAX) model that has an additional explanatory variable or vector autoregression (VAR) model that uses vectors to accommodate the multivariate terms is used to replace ARIMA.
