# Transactions?
- [terminology - Difference between transactions and journal - Academia Stack Exchange](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/13960/difference-between-transactions-and-journal) 
	- These transactions or proceedings were separate from journals, which do not have to coincide with a conference or meeting. However, with time the customs changed, and **many of these reputable publishing venues became independent from actual meetings or conferences**. **But, because they were reputable (and famous is some cases), the name remained.**
	- There is no difference.
		- In particular, _IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering_ is a journal, as are all the other _IEEE Transactions_.
	- Based on length:
		- IEEE Transactions generally contain major manuscripts approximately 8 to 10 printed pages or 24 to 30 double-spaced pages.
		- IEEE Journals follow the same length criteria as Transactions, but often are focused on selected topics and more specialized areas of interest.
		- IEEE Letters are generally short papers of approximately three to four printed pages or nine double-spaced pages.
