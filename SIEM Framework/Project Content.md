# Project Proposal
- Creation/Ideation:
	- Cost-effective framework/architecture to obtain event/log visibility
	- Log management framework that achieves consistent and cost effective visibility in modular fashion and without using unaffordable proprietary technology
- Research:
	- Preliminary research will also be utilized to inform and guide the development of the framework.
- Implementation:
	- Utilize open source or free technology with the framework for a log management and/or visibility stack that allows for detection engineering
