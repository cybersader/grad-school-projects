	- 84%: Believe their organizations would benefit from cloud-native SIEM. Interest in cloud-native security information and event management is high for several reasons. Two of them: 88% of organizations have challenges with their current SIEM platform, and 99% would like additional SIEM automation.. _Source: [2020 State of SecOps and Automation](https://www.sumologic.com/brief/state-of-secops/) (Dimensional Research for Sumo Logic)_
	- 87%: Have outsourced at least one security service Almost nine in 10 organizations use a managed security service provider for at least one security function. The most commonly outsourced security functions include monitoring/managing SIEM systems, vulnerability scanning, and log monitoring and analysis.

	- Notably, a majority of the organizations who actively used a SIEM platform reported higher levels of confidence (60%) in their security posture, those who didn’t use a SIEM at all 46% were not confident in their security, further cementing the utility of SIEM platforms in not only improving security capabilities, but also raising morale.
	- Despite the many benefits that SIEM platforms provide, [numerous hurdles are preventing organizations](https://www.coresecurity.com/blog/overcome-these-3-challenges-achieve-siem-success) from realizing the full value of their platforms. The report indicates that the lack of skilled staff to effectively operate SIEM remains the biggest challenge (41%). Though this is an industry-wide phenomenon, it is concerning to note that nearly half of the organizations share a similar dilemma. This shortage may also fuel a surge in managed solutions delivered as-a-service as organizations seek to bridge this personnel gap. The following two challenges are, handling too many false positives (37%), and a lack of budget (34%), highlighting the difficulty in configuring and fine-tuning it and the dilemma of balancing IT security budgetary allocations, respectively.
