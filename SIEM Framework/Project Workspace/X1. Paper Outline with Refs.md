# Intro
## Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)
- Definition of SIEM
- My perspective
- Components of SIEM
- Compared to data analytics
- Threats

- [What is SIEM? | Microsoft Security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-siem) 
	- Security information and event management, SIEM for short, is a solution that helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond to security threats before they harm business operations. SIEM, pronounced “sim,” combines both security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) into one security management system. SIEM technology collects event log data from a range of sources, identifies activity that deviates from the norm with real-time analysis, and takes appropriate action. In short, SIEM gives organizations visibility into activity within their network so they can respond swiftly to potential [cyberattacks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-a-cyberattack) and meet compliance requirements. In the past decade, SIEM technology has evolved to make threat detection and incident response smarter and faster with artificial intelligence.

	- Threats - refer to cybersecurity circumstances or events with the _potential to cause harm_ by way of their outcome

	- SIEMs alone aren't enough. Teams must utilize data from threat intel and other third-party sources 

## Detections - Data & Protocols
- Abstractions
- RFCs and History
- Data Formats & History
- Protocols
- Detection is best when normalizing and standardizing all the data to one format and using protocols and standards to make that data organized and/or available in some sort of storage that can be analyzed.

	- Before JSON: Complicated Times
	- Imagine computers talking to each other. They needed a common language to understand each other’s data. Back then, [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) was the main language. But it was like using too many words to say something simple. It made things harder for software developers.
	- The Birth of JSON: A Fresh Start
	- Around the year 2000, a smart person named [Douglas Crockford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford) had a great idea. He saw the trouble with [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) and decided to create a new way to share data. He called it [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), and it was like a new way to talk to computers. [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) used simple words that both humans and computers could understand easily.

	- JSON was first introduced by [Douglas Crockfold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford) in 2001. Since then, JSON has been adopted by all the big tech companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter etc. Before JSON was popular, XML was a standard way for most data exchange purposes. XML is still used by many enterprise companies like Amazon AWS. Since the rise of smartphone and mobile applications, REST API and JSON have become default choice of developers.

# Security Team Research
## SIEM Usage with Security Teams
- Why SIEMs are important to security

- [35 stats that matter to your Security Operations team | TechBeacon](https://techbeacon.com/security/35-stats-matter-your-security-operations-team) 
	- 84%: Believe their organizations would benefit from cloud-native SIEM. Interest in cloud-native security information and event management is high for several reasons. Two of them: 88% of organizations have challenges with their current SIEM platform, and 99% would like additional SIEM automation.. _Source: [2020 State of SecOps and Automation](https://www.sumologic.com/brief/state-of-secops/) (Dimensional Research for Sumo Logic)_
	- 87%: Have outsourced at least one security service Almost nine in 10 organizations use a managed security service provider for at least one security function. The most commonly outsourced security functions include monitoring/managing SIEM systems, vulnerability scanning, and log monitoring and analysis.

	- 
- [The State of Security: SIEM in 2022 | Tripwire](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/state-of-security-siem)
	- 348 cybersecurity professionals and represents one of the industry’s most comprehensive annual studies on SIEM, exploring the latest trends, key challenges, and solution preferences in this market.
	- Notably, a majority of the organizations who actively used a SIEM platform reported higher levels of confidence (60%) in their security posture, those who didn’t use a SIEM at all 46% were not confident in their security, further cementing the utility of SIEM platforms in not only improving security capabilities, but also raising morale.
	- Despite the many benefits that SIEM platforms provide, [numerous hurdles are preventing organizations](https://www.coresecurity.com/blog/overcome-these-3-challenges-achieve-siem-success) from realizing the full value of their platforms. The report indicates that the lack of skilled staff to effectively operate SIEM remains the biggest challenge (41%). Though this is an industry-wide phenomenon, it is concerning to note that nearly half of the organizations share a similar dilemma. This shortage may also fuel a surge in managed solutions delivered as-a-service as organizations seek to bridge this personnel gap. The following two challenges are, handling too many false positives (37%), and a lack of budget (34%), highlighting the difficulty in configuring and fine-tuning it and the dilemma of balancing IT security budgetary allocations, respectively.
	- With the increased functionality available now, they perform better on all fronts, with 85% of the surveyed enterprises reporting that their SIEM has been effective in identifying and remediating threats. An overwhelming majority of the respondent SIEM users have reported that SIEM has helped them enhance their threat detection abilities (81%), while a further 84% of the participants experienced a measurable reduction in security breaches due to the use of their SIEM platform.
	- Top reasons for SIEMs:
		- More efficient security operations (21%).
		- Faster detection of and response to security events (14%).
		- Better visibility into threats (13%).

- [Report shows cybersecurity budgets increased 6% for 2022-2023 cycle | Security Magazine](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/99943-report-shows-cybersecurity-budgets-increased-6-for-2022-2023-cycle)
	- This year, 550 Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and other security executives provided data.
	- Despite the economic uncertainty and inflation, [security budgets](https://www.securitymagazine.com/blogs/14-security-blog/post/98154-how-to-protect-cybersecurity-budgets) generally continued to rise but at a lower rate than prior years. Respondents reported an average security budget increase of 6%, a decrease from the 17% increase in the previous budget cycle and marks a 65% reduction in growth. Across industries, the decline was most prominent in technology firms, which dropped from +30% growth in 2021-2022 to +5% this year, with more than 33% of organizations freezing or cutting [cybersecurity](https://www.securitymagazine.com/topics/2788-cybersecurity) budgets.
	- While security budgets are increasing at a lower rate, security budgets as a share of Information Technology (IT) budgets are trending up, suggesting the impact on security spending is moderate compared to IT spending. Since 2020, security spending relative to IT spending has increased from 8.6% to 11.6%, with technology firms reporting the largest proportional spending at 19%.
	- Across industries, the tech and retail sectors had the largest share of organizations with declining security budgets. The consumer goods and services sector, as well as legal firms, had the highest percentage of budgets remaining flat year-over-year. In contrast, in the business services sector, more than three-fourths of companies had increased budgets.
	- Firms funded by venture capital (VC) or private equity (PE) firms maintain relatively high security budgets. Compared to publicly listed companies, not-for-profit organizations, and other forms of private enterprises, VC-backed firms have an outsized security budget percentage, averaging nearly 30%, which is more than two-times the overall percentage.
	- 63% of respondents received a budget increase. In 20% of the cases, the increase was a routine annual adjustment, corresponding to an average budget increase of 7%. Increased risk and digital transformation debuted as a reason this year with 17% and 15% respectively.
	- Cloud-based architectures outspend on-premise designs on staff. Staff and compensation continue to be the largest budget category, claiming 38% of the security budget. Companies that are fully in the cloud have a higher allocation for staff (47%) than companies that are fully on-premise (35%).

		- Use security AI and automation to increase speed and accuracy In the 2023 report, only 28% of organizations used security AI and automation extensively in their operations, which means many organizations have a significant opportunity to improve their speed, accuracy and efficiency. Extensive use of security AI and automation delivered nearly USD 1.8 million in data breach cost savings and accelerated the time to identify and contain a breach by more than 100 days compared to organizations with no use. Security teams can benefit from having security AI and automation embedded throughout their tool sets. For example, 03 using security AI and automation across threat detection and response tools can help analysts detect new threats more accurately and contextualize and triage security alerts more effectively. These technologies can also automate portions of the threat investigation process or recommend actions to speed response. Additionally, AI-driven data security and identity solutions can help drive a proactive security posture by identifying high risk transactions, protecting them with minimal user friction and stitching together suspicious behaviors more effectively

		- Number of breaches identified by an organization’s own security teams or tools Only one-third of companies discovered the data breach through their own security teams, highlighting a need for better threat detection. 67% of breaches were reported by a benign third party or by the attackers themselves. When attackers disclosed a breach, it cost organizations nearly USD 1 million more compared to internal detection

	- Security-driven data can be dimensional, dynamic, and heterogeneous, thus, data warehouse solutions are less effective in delivering the agility and performance users need.
	- A data lake is considered a subset of a data warehouse, however, in terms of flexibility, it is a major evolution. The data lake is more flexible and supports unstructured and semi-structured data, in its native format and can include log files, feeds, tables, text files, system logs, and more.
	- For example, .03 cents per/GB/per month if in an S3 bucket. This capability makes the data lake the penultimate evolution of the SIEM.

	- Security-driven data can be dimensional, dynamic, and heterogeneous, thus, data warehouse solutions are less effective in delivering the agility and performance users need.
	- A data lake is considered a subset of a data warehouse, however, in terms of flexibility, it is a major evolution. The data lake is more flexible and supports unstructured and semi-structured data, in its native format and can include log files, feeds, tables, text files, system logs, and more.
	- For example, .03 cents per/GB/per month if in an S3 bucket. This capability makes the data lake the penultimate evolution of the SIEM.

	* It turned out that security teams didn’t have time for a science project like Apache Spot or Metron.
	* The Hadoop data lake was causing enough headaches for the core business units that depended on it, and security had alternatives available in purpose-built SIEM and log management systems.
	* Apache Spot
	* One reason why they are being chosen over legacy incumbents in the SIEM market is that these providers don’t have to spend precious cycles developing and maintaining their data backend.

	- Security-driven data can be dimensional, dynamic, and heterogeneous, thus, data warehouse solutions are less effective in delivering the agility and performance users need. A data lake is considered a subset of a data warehouse, however, in terms of flexibility, it is a major evolution. The data lake is more flexible and supports unstructured and semi-structured data, in its native format and can include log files, feeds, tables, text files, system logs, and more. You can stream all of your security data, none is turned away, and everything will be retained. This can easily be made accessible to a security team at a low cost. For example, .03 cents per/GB/per month if in an S3 bucket. This capability makes the data lake the penultimate evolution of the SIEM.
	- The value of the process is to compare newly observed behavior with historical trends, sometimes comparing to datasets spanning 10 years. This would be cost-prohibitive in a traditional SIEM.
	- Interesting companies to power your security data lake:
		- If you are planning on deploying a security data lake or already have, here are **three cutting edge companies** you should know about. I am not an employee of any of these companies, but I am very familiar with them and believe that each will change our industry in a very meaningful way and can transform your own security data lake initiative.
		- 1. [**Panther:**](https://schoenbaum.medium.com/proxy?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.panther.com)Snowflake is a wildly popular data platform primarily focused on mid-market to enterprise departmental use. It was not a SIEM and had no security capabilities. Along came engineers from AWS and Airbnb who created Panther, a platform for threat detection and investigations. The company recently connected Panther with Snowflake and is able to join data between the two platforms to make Snowflake a “next-generation SIEM” or — perhaps better positioning — evolve Snowflake into a highly-performing, cost-effective, security data lake. It is still a newer solution, but it’s a cool idea with a lot of promise and has been replacing Splunk implementations at companies like Dropbox and others at an impressive clip. If you want to get a sense for what the future will look like, [you can even try it for free here.](https://schoenbaum.medium.com/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpanther.com%2Ffree-trial%2F)
		- 2. [**Team Cymru**](https://schoenbaum.medium.com/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fteam-cymru.com%2F) is the most powerful security company you have yet to hear of. They have assembled a global network of sensors that “listen” to IP-based traffic on the internet as it passes through ISP’s and can “see” and therefore know more than anyone in a typical SOC. They have built the company by selling this data to large, public security companies such as Crowdstrike, [FireEye](https://schoenbaum.medium.com/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fireeye.com%2Fmandiant%2Fthreat-intelligence%2Fthreat-intelligence-subscriptions.html), [Microsoft](https://schoenbaum.medium.com/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsecurity%2Fbusiness%2Fsolutions), and now Palo Alto Networks, with their acquisition of [Expanse, which they snapped up for a cool $800M](https://schoenbaum.medium.com/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2020%2F11%2F16%2Fpalo-alto-networks-ceo-new-acquisition-provides-security-from-hackers-view.html). In addition, cutting-edge SOC teams at JPMC and Walmart are embracing Cymru’s telemetry data feed. Now you can get access to this same data, you will want their 50+ data types and 10+ years of intelligence inside of your data lake to help your team to better identify adversaries and bad actors based on certain traits such as IP or other signatures.
		1. [**Varada.io**:](https://schoenbaum.medium.com/proxy?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.varada.io) The entire value of a security data lake is easy, rapid, and unfettered access to vast amounts of information. It eliminates the need to move and duplicate data and offers the agility and flexibility users demand. As data lakes grow, queries become slower and require extensive data-ops to meet business requirements. Cloud storage may be cheap, but compute becomes very expensive quickly as query engines are most often based on full scans. Varada solved this problem by indexing and virtualizing all critical data in any dimension. Data is kept closer to the SOC — on SSD volumes — in its granular form so that data consumers can leverage the ultimate flexibility in running any query whenever they need. The benefit is a query response time up to 100x faster at a much cheaper rate by avoiding time-consuming full scans. This enables workloads such as the search for attack indicators, post-incident investigation, integrity monitoring, and threat-hunting. Varada was so innovative that data vendor [Starburst](https://schoenbaum.medium.com/proxy?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.starburst.io) recently acquired them.
	- The Security Data lake, while not a simple, “off the shelf” approach, centralizes all of your critical threat and event data in a large, central repository with simple access. It can still leverage an existing SIEM, which may leverage correlation, machine learning algorithms and even AI to detect fraud by evaluating patterns and then triggering alerts. However configured, the security data lake is an exciting step you should be considering, along with the three innovative companies I mentioned in this article.

- Not worth it

- .
## Framework Scope, Use Cases, Threat Model
- Consolidation is best with small budgets or small teams  
- Detection assumes more advanced threats

- .
## SIEM Framework Benefits
- Easier migration of analytics tools
- Increased interaction between security and other teams - DevSecOps initiatives

	- Researchers surveyed 1,520 security and IT leaders who spend half or more of their time on security issues.
	- Drilling down, we asked the slim majority who say their job has gotten harder to tell us what’s making it harder. This subset’s top challenges: ■ The increasing sophistication of threats (according to 38%, ranking it No. 1 for the third straight year) ■ Security stack complexity (according to 30%) ■ IaaS and SaaS driving challenges in risk monitoring and management (29% and 28%, respectively) ■ Workload demands trapping teams in “react mode” (28%)
	- ■ 64% of SOC teams struggle to pivot from one security tool to the next, with little integration to make it easier.
	- Resilience is a team sport, and most respondents understand that converging security operations with other functions (e.g., collaborating more closely, creating hybrid roles that overlay functions, etc.) holds promise: ■ 81% of organizations are converging aspects of security and IT operations. ■ 69% are converging aspects of security operations and digital experience. ■ 69% are converging aspects of security operations and application development. ■ 61% are converging aspects of security operations and observability.
	- ■ Developing and building an integrated software architecture for security analytics and operations tools (38% versus 21% a year ago, moving to the top spot from a tie for third)
	- Top 3 priorities (most mentioned):
		- 35% Security automation
		- 53% Cloud security
		- 31% DevSecOps
		- 33% Analytics and Supply Chain Security
		- 31% Security awareness training

- Most common issue is "upstream" failure that affects downstream processing and pipelines
- Consolidate data activities to data pipelining platform

- Didn't have time to show in the paper
## Applying the SIEM Framework in Different Scenarios
- Small vs large businesses
- Security-only data vs. consolidation with other data teams, NOCs, developers, DevOps, etc
- Storage amount
- Query usage
